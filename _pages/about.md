I am a PhD student of Statistics at Imperial College London on the [EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial and Oxford](https://statml.io/), supervised by [Din-Houn Lau](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~fdl06/) and [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/). My research interests lie in Monte Carlo methods, tree-based models and statistical machine learning.
