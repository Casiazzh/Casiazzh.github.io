I am a PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London. I joined the [EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial and Oxford](https://statml.io/) in 2020 under the supervision of Professor [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) and Dr [Andrew Duncan](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/). My research interests lie in computational Bayesian statistics and approximate inference.
