## Short Bio

I am a [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) student in Mathematical Statistics at University of Cambridge. I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London in 2019. Prior to my undergraduate, I studied A Levels and GCSEs at [Beijing New Talent Academy](http://www.bjnewtalent.com/jianqiao/) in Beijing, China.

In summer 2019, I was a summer research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. Specifically, I worked on training NLP models on medical records provided by the SickKids Hospital in order to identify Sepsis at an early stage, thereby allowing prompt treatment. This research was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was supported by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website.
