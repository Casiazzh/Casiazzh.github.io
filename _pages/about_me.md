## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at Imperial College London. I am on the [CDT in StatML](https://statml.io/) programme, which is jointly organized by Imperial Collage and University of Oxford.

Before commencing my PhD, I completed a [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at University of Cambridge, focusing on Mathematical Statistics and optimization. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London in 2019. 

In summer 2019, I was a summer research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. Specifically, I worked on training NLP models on medical records provided by the SickKids Hospital in order to identify Sepsis at an early stage, thereby allowing prompt treatment. This research was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was supported by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website.
