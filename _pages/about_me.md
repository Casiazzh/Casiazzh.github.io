## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at Imperial College London. I am on the [CDT in StatML](https://statml.io/) programme, which is jointly organized by Imperial Collage and University of Oxford.

Before commencing my PhD, I completed [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at University of Cambridge, where my focus was on Mathematical Statistics and optimization. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London in 2019. 

I spent my summer in 2019 as a research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. There, I worked on training NLP models by using triage data from the SickKids Hospital to help the early-stage diagnosis of Sepsis. This project was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was funded by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website.

I joined [Bridges for Enterprise](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/) (BfE) as a Global Analytics and Algorithm Manager in February 2021. BfE is a global non-profit providing pro-bono advisory services to social enterprise startups in the developing world. My job at BfE is to oversee the Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects in its Tech division. Find out more about what they do and the opportunities the offer on their [website](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/).

Besides statistics and voluntary works, I enjoy playing basketball and hiking.
