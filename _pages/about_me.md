## Short Bio

I am a PhD student at Imperial College London. I am on the [CDT in StatML](https://statml.io/) programme, which is jointly organized by Imperial Collage and University of Oxford.

Before commencing my PhD, I completed [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) in Maths at University of Cambridge, where my focus was on Mathematical Statistics and optimization. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London in 2019. 

I spent my summer in 2019 as a research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. There, I worked on training NLP models using triage data from the SickKids Hospital to help early-stage diagnosis of Sepsis, thereby allowing prompt treatment. This research was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was funded by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website.
