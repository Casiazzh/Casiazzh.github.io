## Short Bio

I'm currently doing [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) in Mathematical Statistics at University of Cambridge. My research interests lie in Monte Carlo methods, Gaussian Process and statistical machine learning. I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) at Imperial College London. Prior to my undergrad, I studied A Levels and GCSEs at [Beijing New Talent Academy](http://www.bjnewtalent.com/jianqiao/) in Beijing, China. You can find some of ... [**READ MORE**]

In summer 2019, I was a summer research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. Specifically, I'm working on building models for identifying Sepsis using datasets provided by the EPIC system at the SickKids Hospital, thereby raising alerts to relevant clinicians at (hopefully) the earliest possible stage. This research was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and it was supported by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found therein.
